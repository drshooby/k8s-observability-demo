# k8s-observability-demo
to learn cluster observability tools

Current stack idea:
- Docker Desktop - local K8s cluster
- Istio - service mesh for routing
- Prometheus - metric collection
- Grafana - dashboard and visualization
- Kiali (maybe) - service mesh topology and heatlh viewer
- Go Microservices - to generate traffic and metrics
